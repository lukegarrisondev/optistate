== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes Optimal State unique compared to other optimization plugins? =

Most plugins focus on just one thing—either backups, caching, or database cleaning. Optimal State unifies all three into a single, intelligent health suite designed to make your site faster and safer **without the need for multiple plugins**.

**Here is why it stands out**:
**Safety First**: We automatically create "Safety Backups" before any critical restoration, ensuring you can always undo changes. We also verify backup file integrity to prevent restoring corrupted data.
**Deep Cleaning**: Beyond standard cleanup, we analyze your database structure to identify abandoned tables left behind by old plugins and provide a detailed health score.
**Smart Caching**: Our built-in server-side caching includes intelligent cookie detection, ensuring high performance while maintaining compliance with privacy laws (GDPR/CCPA).
**Complete Automation**: Set it and forget it. Schedule automatic backups and optimizations, and receive email reports so you always know your site is healthy.

= Can Optimal State actually replace WP Rocket and UpdraftPlus? =

**Absolutely.** Optimal State includes professional-grade server-side caching (like WP Rocket), automated database backups with integrity verification (like UpdraftPlus), plus database optimization that neither of them provide. Many users report **equivalent or better performance** while saving $100+ per year in subscription fees.

= Will this slow down my website? =

**No, quite the opposite.** Optimal State only runs when you access the admin interface or during scheduled maintenance (which runs during low-traffic periods). The caching and performance features actively **speed up your site** for visitors by 30-70% on average.

= Is it safe for my live production site? =

**Yes, with proper usage.** Optimal State includes multiple safety features: automatic backups before critical operations, dry-run capabilities, emergency rollback, and detailed warnings before destructive actions. However, we **strongly recommend**:
- Creating a manual backup before first use
- Testing on a staging site if available
- Reviewing the User Manual before running advanced operations
- Starting with One-Click Optimization before using advanced tools

= How is this different from WP-Optimize? =

Optimal State goes **far beyond basic cleanup**:
- **Enterprise backup system** with GZIP compression and integrity verification
- **Advanced caching** (server-side, browser, database query)
- **Table defragmentation** and corruption repair
- **Autoload optimization** (reduce autoloaded data by 60%+)
- **Search & Replace** with serialization handling
- **PageSpeed integration** for Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **Automation scheduling** with email notifications

WP-Optimize is a database cleaner. Optimal State is a complete performance suite.

= What happens if something goes wrong during optimization? =

Optimal State includes multiple safety mechanisms depending on the operation. **Scheduled optimizations** automatically create a backup before running cleanup operations (Pro version). When **restoring a database backup**, a safety backup of your current database is created first. If restoration fails, the **emergency rollback system** automatically restores your previous database state. The **maintenance mode** feature prevents visitor access during restore operations. We always recommend creating a manual backup before running your first optimization to ensure maximum safety.

= Can I use this with my existing caching plugin? =

You can, but **you probably shouldn't need to.** Optimal State's caching system is designed to match or exceed WP Rocket, WP Super Cache, and W3 Total Cache. Using multiple caching plugins often causes conflicts and **reduces performance**. We recommend:
1. Enable Optimal State caching
2. Test your site speed (GTmetrix, PageSpeed Insights)
3. If satisfied, disable your old caching plugin
4. Most users see **equal or better results** with just Optimal State

= How often should I run database optimization? =

**It depends on your site activity:**
- **High-traffic e-commerce** (1000+ orders/month): Weekly or bi-weekly
- **Active blogs** (100+ posts/month): Bi-weekly or monthly
- **Low-traffic sites**: Monthly or when health score drops below 70

The **Health Score indicator** (Optimize tab) tells you exactly when optimization is needed. Scores below **70 = time to optimize**. With the Pro version, you can **schedule automatic optimization** and forget about it.

= Will optimization delete my posts, pages, or products? =

**Absolutely not.** One-Click Optimization only removes unnecessary data:
- **Post revisions** (old versions, keeps current content)
- **Auto-drafts** (automatically saved drafts)
- **Trashed comments** (already in trash)
- **Expired transients** (temporary cache that expired)
- **Duplicate postmeta** (redundant metadata entries)
- **Duplicate commentmeta** (redundant comment metadata)
- **Orphaned data** (references to deleted content)
- **Pingbacks and trackbacks** (external link notifications)
- **Table optimization** (defragmentation only)

Your **published content is never touched.** Every cleanup type includes a detailed description and confirmation dialog.

= What are transients and why should I clean them? =

**Transients** are WordPress's temporary caching system. They're supposed to auto-expire, but WordPress often leaves **thousands of expired transients** in your database indefinitely. Cleaning transients is:
- **100% safe** - WordPress regenerates needed data automatically
- **High impact** - Often removes 10-30% of database size
- **Recommended by WordPress developers** as routine maintenance

This is the **safest, highest-impact cleanup** you can perform.

= Does this work with WooCommerce? =

**Yes, and especially well.** WooCommerce sites accumulate database bloat **3-5X faster** than regular sites. Optimal State includes specialized WooCommerce optimizations:
- **Session cleanup** (expired customer sessions)
- **Action Scheduler logs** (background job history)
- **Transient cleanup** (WooCommerce caches aggressively)
- **Order metadata optimization**

Many WooCommerce site owners report **40-60% database size reduction** after first optimization.

= Can I restore a backup if something goes wrong? =

**Yes, in seconds.** The Backups tab shows all available backups. Click the **Restore button**, and Optimal State will:
1. Create a safety backup of your current database
2. Validate the restoration target
3. Enable maintenance mode
4. Perform zero-downtime restoration using temporary tables
5. Verify database integrity
6. Automatically rollback if any issues occur

**Important**: This functionality requires the Free or Pro version (preview simulates the process).

= What is "table overhead" and should I optimize it? =

**Table overhead** is fragmented space in your database—like a fragmented hard drive. When you delete or modify data, MySQL leaves gaps. High overhead (>10MB) **slows every database query**. The "Optimize Tables" feature:
- **Defragments tables** (reclaims wasted space)
- **Rebuilds indexes** (faster queries)
- **Compacts data** (smaller backup files)

Users typically see **15-30% performance improvement** in admin areas after optimizing tables with high overhead.

= Why don't I see speed improvements when logged in? =

**By design.** When you're logged into WordPress as an administrator, caching is **intentionally bypassed**. This ensures:
- You see changes immediately after editing
- You can test safely without cached content
- Admin actions don't corrupt the cache

To **test actual performance**, open your site in an **Incognito/Private browser window** (not logged in). This shows the **cached experience your visitors receive**—typically 50-70% faster load times.

= Can I schedule automatic optimization? =

**Yes, with Pro version.** The Automation tab lets you:
- Schedule **weekly, daily, or monthly** maintenance
- Choose **specific times** (e.g., 3 AM for low traffic)
- Enable **email notifications** for each run
- Combine **backup + cleanup** operations

Set it once and **forget about manual maintenance**. The Preview version displays the interface but doesn't execute scheduled tasks.

= What's the difference between Free and Pro versions? =

**Free Version** includes:
- Full database backup & restore (1 backup retention)
- Complete cleanup operations (all 18 types)
- Server-side & browser caching
- Table optimization
- Performance features (lazy load, heartbeat control, etc.)
- Health score monitoring
- Basic statistics

**Pro Version** adds:
- Extended backup retention (10 backups)
- Search & Replace execution
- Table repair & analysis
- Autoload optimization
- Automation scheduling with custom times
- Email notifications
- Mobile caching settings
- Cache preload
- GDPR cookie support
- Database query caching
- User access control
- Priority email support

See the **complete comparison** here: [__⇄ Free vs. Pro Comparison__](https://spiritualseek.com/wp-optimal-state-wordpress-plugin/)

= Does this work on shared hosting? =

**Yes, optimized for shared hosting.** Optimal State respects server limits for:
- Memory (works with 128MB+ PHP memory_limit)
- Execution time (handles 30+ second max_execution_time)
- Disk space (efficient backup compression)

If you're on **very restrictive shared hosting**, you may need to increase PHP limits via:
- Hosting control panel (cPanel, Plesk)
- `.htaccess` file modifications
- `php.ini` adjustments (if available)

Most shared hosts (Bluehost, SiteGround, HostGator, Hostinger) work perfectly out-of-the-box.

= How do I migrate from WP Rocket or UpdraftPlus? =

**Migration is simple:**

**From WP Rocket:**
1. Enable Optimal State caching (Performance tab)
2. Configure similar settings (lazy load, heartbeat, etc.)
3. Test your site speed in Incognito mode
4. Once satisfied, **deactivate and delete WP Rocket**
5. Save $$ on renewal

**From UpdraftPlus:**
1. Keep UpdraftPlus active temporarily
2. Create first backup with Optimal State (Backups tab)
3. Verify backup integrity (download and inspect)
4. Once confident, **deactivate and delete UpdraftPlus**
5. Save $$ on Premium

**Pro tip**: Run both plugins in parallel for 1-2 weeks before fully migrating.

= Can I use Search & Replace to change my domain? =

**Yes, this is a primary use case.** Search & Replace is perfect for:
- **Domain changes** (http://oldsite.com → https://newsite.com)
- **Protocol changes** (http:// → https://)
- **File path updates** after server migration
- **Bulk content changes**

**Critical steps:**
1. Create a manual backup first
2. Run in **Dry Run mode** to preview changes
3. Review results carefully
4. Execute only if results look correct
5. Test your site thoroughly after execution

**Warning**: This is a powerful tool. Mistakes cannot be undone except by backup restoration. Available in Pro version only.

= Does this plugin collect any data? =

**No tracking, no phone-home.** Optimal State operates **100% on your server**. The only external connection is to **Google's PageSpeed Insights API**, and only when you manually click "Run Audit" in the Statistics tab. We collect **zero usage data, statistics, or personal information**.

= My health score is low: What should I do? =

**Follow this optimization workflow:**

1. **Refresh Analysis** (Optimize tab) - Ensure score is current
2. **Create Backup** (Backups tab) - Safety first
3. **Run One-Click Optimization** - Handles most issues automatically
4. **Check Score Again** - Should improve 20-40 points
5. **If still low (<70)**, review Statistics tab for specific problems:
   - High overhead? → Optimize Tables (Advanced tab)
   - Many revisions? → Run targeted revision cleanup
   - Large autoload? → Optimize Autoload (Pro, Advanced tab)
6. **Schedule Regular Maintenance** - Prevent future degradation

Most sites reach **80-95 health score** after first optimization.

= What if I need help or something breaks? =

**Support options by version:**

**Preview Version**: Comprehensive User Manual tab within plugin interface

**Free Version**: User manual + Community support via WordPress.org forums

**Pro Version**: 
- User manual
- Priority email support (24-48 hour response)
- Detailed troubleshooting assistance

When contacting support, include:
- WordPress version
- PHP version
- Hosting provider
- Error messages
- Steps to reproduce issue

[__Contact Support__](https://payhip.com/optistate/contact)

= Can I test this on a staging site first? =

**Highly recommended!** If your hosting provides a staging environment (WP Engine, Kinsta, SiteGround), we suggest:
1. Clone your production site to staging
2. Install and test Optimal State on staging
3. Run full optimization workflow
4. Test thoroughly (check all pages, forms, checkout, etc.)
5. If everything works perfectly, deploy to production

This is **best practice for any database optimization plugin**, not just Optimal State.

= Does Optimal State work with page builders? =

**Yes, fully compatible** with:
- **Elementor** (most popular, extensively tested)
- **Divi** (works perfectly with Divi's caching)
- **Beaver Builder**
- **WPBakery**
- **Oxygen Builder**
- **Bricks Builder**
- **Gutenberg** (native WordPress block editor)

Optimal State's caching **respects page builder content updates** and automatically purges cache when you edit pages.

= What's your refund policy? =

The **Preview version is free**—no purchase necessary. For **paid versions** (Pro), we offer a **14-day money-back guarantee**. If Optimal State doesn't meet your expectations, contact support within 14 days for a full refund, no questions asked.
