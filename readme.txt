WP Optimal State Free/Pro - v1.2.0

Transform your WordPress site into a lean, high-performance machine with WP Optimal State Pro. This all-in-one optimization suite combines professional-grade database maintenance, intelligent backup management, and advanced caching systems into a single powerful plugin.

Why Your Database Needs WP Optimal State Pro
Every WordPress site naturally accumulates digital clutter over time. Draft revisions multiply with each save, spam comments pile up, orphaned metadata lingers after content deletion, and expired temporary data remains in your database. This accumulation degrades site speed, inflates hosting storage, and impacts overall performance.

WP Optimal State Pro tackles these issues head-on with a sophisticated yet user-friendly approach to database maintenance.

Core Capabilities
Smart Database Optimization. The plugin provides granular control over what gets cleaned and when. Choose from 18 different cleanup operations including post revisions, auto-drafts, spam comments, orphaned metadata, duplicate entries, and expired transients. The one-click optimization feature intelligently processes all safe operations simultaneously, while advanced users can optimize individual tables, repair corrupted data, and streamline autoloaded options.

Enterprise-Grade Backup System. Security is paramount when working with databases. WP Optimal State Pro implements a chunked backup system that handles databases of any size without server timeouts. Each backup includes SHA-256 checksums for integrity verification, metadata tracking, and configurable retention policies. The restore process incorporates automatic safety backups with rollback capability, ensuring your site remains protected even if restoration encounters issues.

Dual-Layer Caching Architecture. Accelerate your site with server-side HTML caching that serves pre-rendered pages instantly, bypassing PHP and database queries entirely. Complement this with browser caching rules that instruct visitors’ browsers to store static assets locally. The system includes mobile-specific caching, cookie consent detection, customizable exclusion patterns, and automatic cache preloading from sitemaps.

Performance Fine-Tuning Suite. Control WordPress core features to eliminate unnecessary overhead. Disable XML-RPC for security, limit post revisions to prevent bloat, adjust the Heartbeat API frequency to reduce server load, and remove unused components like emoji scripts and shortlinks. Each optimization includes clear descriptions of its impact.

Intelligent Automation Schedule cleanup operations to run automatically at your preferred time, with configurable frequency from daily to yearly. Email notifications keep you informed of completed tasks, backup creation, and any issues requiring attention.

Database Health Monitoring. The integrated health scoring system analyzes your database across performance, cleanliness, and efficiency metrics, providing actionable recommendations based on actual data analysis.
Built exclusively for single-site WordPress installations with security, reliability, and performance at its core.

Release Notes v1.2.0:
1. Smart Polling Intervals: Updated admin.js to dynamically adjust the polling interval in pollRestoreStatus based on the server's response time, reducing admin-ajax.php load during long restores. 
2. Resilient Rate Limiting: Improved check_rate_limit to handle rapid concurrent requests more gracefully by utilizing set_transient with a shorter expiration buffer. 
3. Database Size Caching: Modified get_total_database_size to force a cache refresh ($force_refresh = true) immediately after a "One-Click Optimization" to ensure the dashboard reflects accurate gains. 
4. Memory Management: Enhanced _backup_table_data_chunked to call gc_collect_cycles() more frequently during the export of large tables like wp_posts, preventing memory exhaustion errors. 
5. Regex Pattern Caching: Cached the compilation of exclude patterns in get_compiled_exclude_patterns to a static property, improving page load performance when "Server-Side Caching" is enabled.
6. Fixed: Addressed an issue in clean_orphaned_postmeta where the DELETE query could time out on extremely large databases by implementing stricter LIMIT batching. 
7. Fixed: Corrected a logic error in is_safe_restore_query that occasionally flagged valid INSERT statements containing the word "DROP" within the content string as security risks.
8. Fixed: get_trusted_host now correctly sanitizes the HTTP_HOST header to prevent potential cache poisoning when generating cache file paths. 
9. Fixed: Ensured restore_backup properly resets the optistate_maintenance_mode_active option if a fatal error occurs during the restoration process.
10. Code Hardening: Applied stricter sanitize_text_field input validation in ajax_save_auto_settings to prevent non-numeric values from being saved for auto_optimize_days.
